  <statement>
    <p>
      Let <m>V</m> be the set of all pairs <m>(x,y)</m> of real numbers
      together with the following operations:
    </p>
      <me>(x_1,y_1)\oplus (x_2,y_2)=\left(x_{1} x_{2},\,y_{1} y_{2}\right)</me><me>c \odot (x,y) =\left(x^{c},\,y^{c}\right).</me>
    <p>
      (a) Show that there exists an additive identity element, that is:
    </p>
    <me>
      \text{There exists }(w,z)\in V\text{ such that }(x,y)\oplus(w,z)=(x,y).
    </me>
    <p>
      (b) Explain why <m>V</m> nonetheless is not a vector space.
    </p>
  </statement>
  <answer>
    <p>
      <m>V</m> is not a vector space, which may be shown by demonstrating that
      any one of the following properties do not hold:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>additive inverses do not always exist</li>
    </ul>
  </answer>
